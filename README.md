# Matrix Nim SDK (CS & AS)
A [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) library for the [client-server](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1.html) and [appservice](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/application_service/r0.1.2.html) API's written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org)!

## Status
- This is a maintained fork of @dylhack's Matrix Nim SDK.
 - We are currently targetting **v1.3** of the Matrix specification, development will happen on the *devel* branch, and hopefully stable support will emerge on the *v1.3* branch.
 - Not ready for production. The library is actively worked on and there will be a version one released when it's ready for general use.

## 100% Pure!
This is a pure Nim library, meaning it can be used where ever Nim can compile to, such as; NodeJS, front-end JavaScript, C, and C++.

## Multi Sync Support
The library produces both blocking and asynchronous code for native and javascript environments.

## Community
The original matrix room at [#matrix-nim-sdk:newcircuit.io](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-nim-sdk:newcircuit.io) has no admin.
